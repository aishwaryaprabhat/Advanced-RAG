## Introduction 🌟
The `Advanced_RAG.ipynb` notebook in this repository provides an in-depth analysis and implementation of three RAG techniques and six RAG evaluation techniques. Additionally, it demonstrates how to track evaluation experiments using MLflow.

## RAG Techniques 🛠️
The notebook details the following RAG techniques:
- **Chunks with Overlap 🧩**: Splits the document into overlapping chunks of text.
- **Sentence Window Retrieval 🪟**: Utilizes surrounding sentences as context for retrieval.
- **Hierarchical Automerge Retrieval 🔼**: Combines hierarchical data organization with retrieval augmentation for more contextually rich results.

## Evaluating RAG Techniques 📊
The notebook demonstrates the evaluation of RAG techniques using the following metrics:
- **Context Precision 🔍**
- **Context Recall 🎯**
- **Faithfulness 🤝**
- **Answer Relevancy 🎯**
- **Answer Similarity ↔️**
- **Answer Correctness ✅**

## Experiment Tracking 📈
The experiment tracking section showcases how to use Microsoft Azure ML Studio and MLflow for tracking and analyzing the results of your RAG evaluations. 

## Installation 📥
While the steps detailed below are also in the `Advanced_RAG.ipynb` notebook for running in a hosted environment like Google Colab or AzureML Studio, you may choose to set up your environment locally.

1. **Clone the Repository** 📂: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Advanced-RAG.git
   cd Advanced-RAG
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** 💾: 
   Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Preparation** 📊:
   Run the `download_dataset.sh` script to download the necessary data:
   ```bash
   chmod +x download_dataset.sh
   ./download_dataset.sh
   ```

## Usage 💻
- Open the `Advanced_RAG.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
- Follow the instructions and code cells in the notebook to explore the various RAG techniques and evaluations.
